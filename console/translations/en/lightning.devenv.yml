            top-level components checked out in directories next to the main
            Lightning repo. Are you sure you want to continue?'

              a normal install it is 2.'
  branch_name: 'What branch should the external components have checked out?'
  prefix: 'The prefix to append to exterbnal component directory names when
           searching for them. This is useful, for example, when you want to use
