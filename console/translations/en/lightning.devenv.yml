success: 'Successfully symlinked %d of %d Lightning components: %s.'
questions:
  confirm: >
    This command will remove the Lightning Components from your module
    directory and symlink them to existing repos outside of Lightning VCS root.
    You should ensure that you have all of Lightning's top-level components
    checked out in directories next to the main Lightning repo. Are you sure you
    want to continue?
  levels_up: >
    How many levels up from docroot are your external dependencies? In a normal
    setup where the external dependencies are siblings to the Lightning repo, it
    is 2.
  branch: 'What branch should the external components have checked out?'
  prefix: >
    The prefix to append to external component directory names when
    searching for them. This is useful, for example, when you want to use a fork
    of the main components for testing. E.g.: MYNAME_lightning_api.
caution:
  dirty-branch: >
    The following components have uncommitted changes: %s. You should commit or
    stash the changes before continuing.
  wrong-branch: 'The following components are not on the expected branch %s. %s'
exception:
  extension-not-found: ' %s not found. Expected to find it at %s'
  levels-up: '"Levels up" must be an integer greater than or equal to 2.'
